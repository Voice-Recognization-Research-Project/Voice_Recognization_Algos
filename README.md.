# Voice_Recognization_Algos

This repository is dedicated to developing and evaluating speech recognition algorithms on Telugu audio datasets. The project includes implementations and experiments with five different algorithms:

- **Whisper**
- **Wav2Vec 2.0**
- **BiLSTM**
- **HMM**
- **IndicTrans**

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a robust speech recognition system for Telugu language audio. The repository contains:
- **Telugu Audio Datasets:** Collected and preprocessed audio data for training and evaluation.
- **Algorithm Implementations:** Code for five state-of-the-art speech recognition approaches.

## Datasets

The Telugu audio datasets included in this repository are used for training and testing the various models.  
- **Source:** [Add dataset source links or descriptions here]
- **Preprocessing:** [Describe any preprocessing steps or tools used]

## Algorithms

1. **Whisper:**  
   An end-to-end speech recognition model that leverages large-scale training data for robust performance.

2. **Wav2Vec 2.0:**  
   A self-supervised model by Facebook that learns representations directly from raw audio, improving recognition accuracy in low-resource settings.

3. **BiLSTM:**  
   A bidirectional LSTM network that captures context from both past and future audio frames for improved sequence modeling.

4. **HMM (Hidden Markov Model):**  
   A traditional statistical model for speech recognition that segments audio into discrete states.

5. **IndicTrans:**  
   A specialized model aimed at transcription and translation of Indic languages, adapted for Telugu speech recognition.
